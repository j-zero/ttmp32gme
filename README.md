# ttmp32gme
a tool to create tiptoi gme files from mp3 files. Also creates a printable sheet to play the music.

## Features
* convert music/audiobook albums from mp3 to gme format playable with the tiptoi pen using [tttool](http://tttool.entropia.de/).
* automatic generation of control sheets that allow to control playback of music/audiobook.
* flexible print layouts for various applications (see below).
* automatic readout of id3 tags to get album and track info (including embedded cover images).
* add cover images for nicer print layout.
* copy gme files to tiptoi if tiptoi is connected.

## Installation
* Mac/Win: download the executables from the (https://github.com/thawn/ttmp32gme/releases)[releases page]. Put them somewhere and run them. Open localhost:10020 with a browser of your choice (except Internet Explorer). Printing was tested to work with Chrome and Firefox.
* linux: run the perl sources (see below)

## Usage
### 1. Add mp3 files
Add one or more mp3 files on the "Upload" page. Only add one
album at a time.

### 2. Configure and create gme files</h4>
On the "Library" page, you can configure and create gme
files. Mp3 tag data of recently uploaded files will automatically be used to
pre-populate the artist, album title and track info.

### 3. Print the control page(s)
Once you choose to print one or more album from the library,
a new page will open that displays the albums and their tracks from the gme
files that you selected for printing.

You can customize the the print layout by clicking on "<span
class="glyphicon glyphicon-cog"></span> Configure print layout".

You can choose one of the three presets:

list
: A list layout that includes all album details.

tiles
: A tiled layout that includes only minimal album details and general controls that work with all albums.

CD booklet
: A layout that is optimized for printing CD booklets.

Alternatively, you can manually choose which parts (cover image, album
information, album control buttons, track list) to display, how many columns
should be used and how large each album should be when printed.</p>

You can also configure here which resolution should be used (in DPI) for
printing (start with the maximum resolution your printer can handle). And how
many pixels (in x and y direction) each dot of the OID code should use. Start
with a value of 2 (<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nyquist%E2%80%93Shannon_sampling_theorem">read
this if you want to know why</a>). If you have problems with not recognized oid
codes, first try to increase the number of pixels to 3 or 4 and then try to
change the resolution setting.

### 4. Copy the gme files onto the tiptoi pen</h4>
Connect the tiptoi pen to your computer. If you do not see the button "Copy
selected to TipToi", reload the library page. Now select
the desired albums and click on "Copy selected to TipToi". Wait till the
operation completes and a message appears that tells you that it is safe to
disconnect the pen from the computer.
