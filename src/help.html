				<p>
					Once you choose to print one or more album from the <a href="/library">library,</a>
					a new page will open that displays the albums and their tracks from the gme
					files that you selected for printing.
				</p>
				<p>Printing was tested to work with Chrome and Firefox on Mac Os and
					Microsoft Edge on Windows 10 (Chrome and Firefox do not print with high enough
					resolution on Win 10, Opera seems to work occasionally).</p>
				<p>
					You can customize the the print layout by clicking on "<span
						class="glyphicon glyphicon-cog"></span> Configure print layout".
				</p>
				<p>You can choose one of the three presets:</p>
				<dl class="dl-horizontal">
					<dt>list:</dt>
					<dd>A list layout that includes all album details</dd>
					<dt>tiles:</dt>
					<dd>A tiled layout that includes only minimal album details and general
						controls that work with all albums.</dd>
					<dt>CD booklet</dt>
					<dd>A layout that is optimized for printing CD booklets.</dd>
				</dl>
				<p>Alternatively, you can manually choose which parts (cover image, album
					information, album control buttons, track list) to display, how many columns
					should be used and how large each album should be when printed.</p>
				<p>
					You can also configure here which resolution should be used (in DPI) for
					printing (start with the maximum resolution your printer can handle). And how
					many pixels (in x and y direction) each dot of the OID code should use. Start
					with a value of 2 (<a
						href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nyquist%E2%80%93Shannon_sampling_theorem">read
						this if you want to know why</a>). If you have problems with not recognized oid
					codes, first try to increase the number of pixels to 3 or 4 and then try to
					change the resolution setting.
				</p>
				<p>
					Many print drivers have different optimization settings for Graphics/Images and
					Text. Try to set your print driver to Graphic/Image mode (some drivers mess up
					the oid patterns in text mode). If your driver does not have such a setting, try
					to convert the PDF to a 1200 dpi png and print that. If you still have problems,
					check out <a href="https://github.com/entropia/tip-toi-reveng/wiki/Printing">the
						printing tips on the tttool wiki</a> and <a
						href="https://github.com/thawn/ttmp32gme/issues/11">the printing issues in

					<p>It is a known (and sad) fact that the oid codes do not work with all
						printers. This is because the oid codes are very fine detailed patterns and
						need to be reproduced exactly by the printer. Many printers simply do not have
						a good enough resolution or their drivers mess around with the patterns during
						image processing. In the latter case, this can sometimes be circumvented by
						playing around with the print settings but sometimes, it simply does not work.
					</p>

					<ul>
						<li>Make sure to print at 100% scale. Do not use autoscaling or fit to
							paper settings in the print dialog of your printer.</li>
						<li>print in 1200dpi if possible, sometimes 600dpi seem to work.</li>
						<li>play around with the quality settings, resolution, contrast</li>
						<li>use different paper</li>
						<li>try black-and-white versus color prints</li>
					</ul>

					</p>
					Before <a href="https://github.com/thawn/ttmp32gme/issues/11">reporting any
						problem with the pen not recognizing printed pages</a>, please <a
						href="https://github.com/entropia/tip-toi-reveng/wiki/Printing">read the
						wiki page on printer support for tttool.</a>
					</p>

					<p>
						Please try to print <a href="/assets/images/oid-table.png">this oid table</a>.
						When you point the pen at any of the patterns, it should say something like
						"Bitte installieren Sie erst die Audiodatei für dieses Produkt" or "Bitte
						berühre erst das Anschaltzeichen für dieses Produkt". Then at least the pen
						recognized that these are oid codes. If the pen does nothing, this likely means
						that your issue is unrelated to the software but is a problem with the printer.
					</p>

					<p>
						If you still think it is a software issue, please <a
							href="https://github.com/thawn/ttmp32gme/issues/11">report</a> exactly (step
						by step) what you were doing and what (if any) messages the pen is saying,
						otherwise I cannot help you.
