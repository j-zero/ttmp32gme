				<p>
					Once you choose to print one or more album from the <a href="/library">library,</a>
					a new page will open that displays the albums and their tracks from the gme
					files that you selected for printing.
				</p>
				<p>Printing was tested to work with Chrome and Firefox on Mac Os and
					Microsoft Edge on Windows 10 (Chrome and Firefox do not print with high enough
					resolution on Win 10, Opera seems to work occasionally).</p>
				<p>
					You can customize the the print layout by clicking on "<span
						class="glyphicon glyphicon-cog"></span> Configure print layout".
				</p>
				<p>You can choose one of the three presets:</p>
				<dl class="dl-horizontal">
					<dt>list:</dt>
					<dd>A list layout that includes all album details</dd>
					<dt>tiles:</dt>
					<dd>A tiled layout that includes only minimal album details and general
						controls that work with all albums.</dd>
					<dt>CD booklet</dt>
					<dd>A layout that is optimized for printing CD booklets.</dd>
				</dl>
				<p>Alternatively, you can manually choose which parts (cover image, album
					information, album control buttons, track list) to display, how many columns
					should be used and how large each album should be when printed.</p>
				<p>
					You can also configure here which resolution should be used (in DPI) for
					printing (start with the maximum resolution your printer can handle). And how
					many pixels (in x and y direction) each dot of the OID code should use. Start
					with a value of 2 (<a
						href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nyquist%E2%80%93Shannon_sampling_theorem">read
						this if you want to know why</a>). If you have problems with not recognized oid
					codes, first try to increase the number of pixels to 3 or 4 and then try to
					change the resolution setting.
